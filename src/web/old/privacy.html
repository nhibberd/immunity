				<h2><span class="slash">//</span>Privacy Policy</h2>
			
			<p style="text-align: justify;" sizcache="42" sizset="4">This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

<p style="text-align: justify;" sizcache="42" sizset="5">This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information through our websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Personal Information" or "personal data" means any information relating to you that would allow a party to contact you, including, for example, your full name, address, telephone number, or email address.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which we use and protect your Personal Information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our site so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it and, where appropriate, we may notify you by email.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Information we collect and how we use that information</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may collect and process the following Personal Information about you:</p>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will use your Personal Information for internal purposes only and will never sell or share your Personal Information with any third parties, for marketing or any other purposes, other than in circumstances which are compatible with the purposes for which you submitted the information to us. For example, we may provide your Personal Information to an external recruitment agency who we contract to co-ordinate and administer any recruitment exercise on our behalf. Sensitive information such as your income level and expectations will be treated with the utmost discretion and respect for your personal privacy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Should you submit a CV/ resume to us the amount of information you choose to keep confidential is entirely within your discretion. You may enter as much or as little information as you choose. All information posted by you will only be visible to those of our managers and staff who are responsible for recruitment or otherwise directly involved in the hiring process, including associated administrative actions and communications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IP addresses and use of "cookies"</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may collect information about your computer, including where available your internet protocol ("IP") address, operating system and browser type, for system administration.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have implemented, and follow, industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to, and unlawful interception or processing of, Personal Information. The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted via our site. Any transmission is therefore at your own risk.

	<li>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>
	<li>If we become part of another organization, that organization will possess the personal information collected by us, and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
	<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, or others.</li>
</ul>
